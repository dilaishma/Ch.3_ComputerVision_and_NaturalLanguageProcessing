# Ch.3_ComputerVision_and_NaturalLanguageProcessing

I created this repository to explain my team assignment deliverables chapter 3 â€œComputer Vision and Natural Language Processing" in MSIB program at Startup Campus

****Assignment 3 case [1]****
**Computer Vision - Digital Image Processing**

In this case, the task is to replicate the image enhancement algorithm commonly used by smartphone manufacturers.


****Assignment 2 case [2]****
**Computer Vision - Transfer Learning with Pre-trained CNN**

In this case, the task is to implement transfer learning techniques with various pre-trained models from PyTorch and assess the effect of freezing some parts of the neural network layers.


****Assignment 2 case [3]****
**Computer Vision - Real-time Object Detection**

In this case, the task is to implement a PyTorch model to detect objects in real-time.


****Assignment 2 case [4]****
**Natural Language Processing - Text Classification**

In this case, the task is to classify text using a pre-trained BERT model.
